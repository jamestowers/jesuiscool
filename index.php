			<h2> Heres the science:</h2>
			<p>The jersey will be made by original space cadets Milltag, in both men’s and women’s cuts. It has all the features you’d expect of a pressure controlled space-suit, including silicone gripper hems, concealed full length zip and 3 pockets to the rear for “Space Cakes”. There is also a hidden zipped pocket for cash, keys to the space rocket and any samples of moon-dust you may keep about your person… We’re looking at you Lance!</p>

			<p>his time we’ve gone with the club fit. It’s exactly the same quality as the Pina Colada Collection, but with slightly longer sleeves and a slightly tighter cut. If you want more info, check out: <a href="http://milltag.cc">Milltag.cc</a></p>

			<h2>About Je Suis Cool</h2>

			<p>Je Suis Cool is the UK's laziest cycling club. Whilst we push the boundaries of acceptable lycra, we rarely get close to the boundaries of on the bike performance. We’re never afraid to sack off the ride in favour of a swim or spend so long in the pub that it’s no longer possible to cycle home. If that sounds like you, or you’re the kind of cyclist that would un-prompted suggest getting the train home, then welcome to the team.</p>
